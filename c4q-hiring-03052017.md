---

# Outline: This workshop

* Why I'm passionate about hiring, teams, organizations
* How to Prepare
  * Doing your research
* What to learn

Notes: Outline these experiences from few years hiring at high growth startup
coupled with learnings from organizing and colleagues.

---

## Sustaining inclusive and diverse teams begin with inclusive processes

Notes: You are what you eat adage holds true. I believe that an
in order to have an enjoyable hiring that yields diverse, inclusive, creative,productive teams you must
have an inclusive process and as such a participatory team.

----

## Hiring process is the character of team and color of the company culture

Notes: If you have a hiring process or are putting in a more formal one, start by inviting those that want to be a part of it

----

## Hiring is a two way road for both potential candidates and team

- Balance of the power structure

Notes: You learn about them during this time. By setting your own tenets you're
clearer with what you are looking for

# First Steps

* Define your tenets
* Do your research

----

* Why are you looking to leave your current position? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* What do you like to do when you aren’t coding (and the answer can be coding)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Tell me about a project or moment you were most proud of in the last year<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->


---

# @TODO HERE LIST THE TENETS

- Established guidelines for the role
- Clear roles and responsibilities on the team
- Known hiring process/procedure

Notes: These are the tenets that I believe teams must have in place in order to effectively hire. Guess what? most don't. you can use these as a rubric. what follows are questions you can ask and/or clues to look for to help you get a better understanding of the environment and to help you excel through the fire and brime stone. because, yes, yes, all too often the hiring process is horrible
soul wrenching experience. it is this way for everyone.

----

# Questions

Come prepared

Notes: Skip quickly to research

---

# Do your research prior

Notes: Depends a lot what your first touch. If you are applying through an ad,
look up the company team

----

## Researching the team

- Social media presence
- Team page / About us page
  - Makeup of gender
  - Language
- Participation in the community (OSS, Meetups, Conferences)

---

## Questions for teams (phone interview/in person)

- What you your core tenets? What qualities do you most value in your team? What are you looking for?
- What is your tech stack?
- Do you have guidelines for the role? What is expected?
* What are some of the tasks this person will be doing? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Are you hiring for a specific project? What happens after it ends? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Are you filling a specific need? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- What the current roles and responsibilities of your team?
- What's the hiring process? What can I expect? How long does it typically take? (Ask the hiring manager) Whom can I expect to meet and talk to?

Notes: Most places are not going to be considerate and ask about any needs you have so you must volunteer them. don't be shy. if you can't walk a lot or are injured or you aren't a big morning person, communicate. Ask for the possibilitiy of an afternoon slot. Mention your injury.

----

## Framework agnostic
### Tenet: Simplicity

Core languages of our craft: JS, CSS, HTML

Notes: We valued JS, CSS, HTML. I stand that a good developer can and will know everything. I will forever always test core languages over frameworks. I really think it depends where you are applying

---

# First touch says a lot

Notes: How did they reach to you? How did they treat you? Did they respect your time?

---

## Follow up if they say "Right fit later".

Notes: So many people I wanted to hire but needed to wait until there was stability. Be sincere about this by working with TS to keep in touch. As candidate, if you really liked it, follow up, even if you do get a job. If no movement after 6 months, tell candidate.

---

## Get feedback by asking for it

Notes: Candidates, ask for feedback. What's one things I could improve on my test? If tenets, feedback becomes really easy to give.

----

## Define your tenets
### What do you want out of the position?

Notes: What do you want to get out of the job? clear: room to grow, better process; for a new dev could be get a job on respectful teams

----

## Ask about day to day

* What's the process for a typical feature or sprint?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* How do you spend your day?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* What does a typical day for team member look like?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Notes: Ask about someone at your level and also ask above is you are looking to grow

----

## Care about your growth
### Ask about mentorship and career growth

----

* Pairing <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Code review process <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* How are code decisions and standards formed? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Learning budget—encouraged to learn<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* Developer ratio (Junior to Senior)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
* Tech stack<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

Notes: A job for jobs sake will not help you. Signs to look for.

---

## Be open to new languages

Notes: Sometimes the way in is with something else that opens a portal

---

# Reflecting on how I got a foothold

* Creating French graphics in Photoshop
* Manual data entry and small bug fixes


---

## My own small independent project

Notes: Nice segue way to...

---

# Preparing for code challenge

Notes: Code challenges. Different everywhere. Vary a lot by team. I
believe that their design is indicative of the team structure.

----

## Timed challenges

Practice, practice, practice.

* JavaScript 30 Challenge


----

## Take home challenge

More realistic of feature work
Higher expectation based on time
Make a schedule
Clarify any directions after you receive it
Communicate if you need more time
Be ready to communicate your choices and direction

----

## ~Whiteboarding~

Notes: You are not alone in thinking these are horrible

---

## Repos of companies that do not whiteboard

---

### If if you do end up with one,

Test your logic and reasoning. Show your thought pattern.

---

# Tips for Code Challenges

Notes: I'm a bit proponent of take home code challenges. while they can take longer they offer a better view of the candidate

----

## Biggest challenge:

Not demonstrating a strength

----

## Solution: Provide a `recap.md`

Your opportunity to give a bit more context into your code challenge

* What went well? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* What would you improve given/more time resources?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Do you have any feedback on the challenge (what would you change, improve, keep…)?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Notes: Anecdote about how got this from a candidate. These are great way to
provide more perspective about your work

----

@todo examples of recaps

---

## Documentation
### Does your project include a `README.md`?

Notes: how detailed does it get. if you do something different, note it. documentation helps people.

----

@TODO Examples of good readme / bad readme is project directory without a readme

---

# Directory Organization

Notes: Lots of patterns here. Here's good vs signs of lack of organization

----

## Common patterns

@TODO BUILD OUT Add more examples

Within the root folder:

* Core code files: `src/` or `app/` <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Compiled files: `dist`, `public/`, `build/` <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

----

### Example: Good Directory Structure

```
app
├── js
│   │── vendor/
│   │   ├── jquery.js
│   └── main.js
├── css
│   └── main.css
├── views
│   └── index.html
├──
dist
├── // compiled assets

```

---

# Consistency

- Code
- Naming
- File
* Spacing <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Indentation<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Stale code (e.g. commented out)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

---

## Naming is hard, steal

* Clear, concise, patterns <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Remix from other frameworks <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Notes: Check out semantic UI or frameworks for ideas. visit sites you like.

---

## Command & Understanding of HTML

* Are you using the most semantically appropriate element? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

## Know your tags: #1

```
<div class="price">
  ${{ price }}
</div>
```

----

## Answer: Daily Double

```
<label name="price-field">Cost</label>
<output for="price-field" name="price" class="price">
  ${{ price }}
</output>
```

Represents the result of a calculation or user action.

Notes: Okay. Esoteric. But this isn't..

----


```
<div class="btn">
  Get it
</div>
```

## `<div>` is not `<button>`

----

## Know Your Tags: #2

_(HTML is more than divs)_

```html
<div class='item'>
  <div class='item__name'>{{ name }}</div>
  <div class='item_description'>{{ description }}</div>
  <div class='item_price'>{{ price }}</div>
  <div class='item__purchase' data-name='{{ name }}' data-price='{{ price }}'>
    <div class='btn'>
      Get it
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

----

# CSS

* Understanding of specificity<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* CSS Architecture<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Organization<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Style<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

----

## Over-qualifying elements

```
button.delete {

}
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


----

## Do you style IDs?

NAY<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


----

## Empty Rule Sets

Don't leave empty rulesets

```
.price {
}
```


----

## Know your CSS units

Show consistency or understanding of usage patterns

```
.sidebar {
  margin-left: 3%;
  padding: 1.5em 40px;
}
```
----

Notes: Understand what power each unit gives you and why to use it

---

<img src="images/rem-em.png" alt="Screenshot of CSS Tricks article titled Use `rem` for Global sizing; Use `em` for local sizing.">

----

> you still keep px size adjustments at the document level so you can make
easy/efficient sweeping size changes. But then each module on the page has
a font-size set in rem. Actual text elements (h1, h2, p, li, whatever),
if you size them at all, are sized in em, and thus become relative to the module.

----

## Use Autoprefixer for vendor prefixing

No need to handwrite vendor prefixes.

```css
@mixin box-sizing( $type: border-box ) {
    -webkit-box-sizing: $type;
       -moz-box-sizing: $type;
         -o-box-sizing: $type;
        -ms-box-sizing: $type;
            box-sizing: $type;
}

*,
*::before,
*::after {
  @include box-sizing(border-box);
}
```

Notes: If you are using a build process. Autoprefixer is available for most build processes

----

```css
@mixin box-sizing( $type: border-box ) {
  box-sizing: $type;
}

*,
*::before,
*::after {
  @include box-sizing(border-box);
}
```

----

## CSS Architecture

What is CSS Architecture? What do we mean when we say it?

Notes: some are more about styles and less prescriptive about organization. others are more coupled.

----

## CSS Patterns

* OOCSS <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* SMACSS <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* BEM <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* CSS Modules <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* ITCSS <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* ExpressiveCSS <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
* FunctionalCSS <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

---

# stylelint

----

# CSS Modules


----

## Solve problem at hand first
### before adding complexity

----

# Gulp.js for making builds

* Easy to grok <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Lots of tutorials <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* More intuitive working with HTML templates <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Gulp 4.0.0 is stagnant

----

### But isn't Webpack the thing?!?!

Notes: If react job or JS heavy, sure

----

## Avoid coupling HTML + JS

```
$(".cart .count").html(count);
$(".cart .total").html(total);
```

Notes: Going to refactor.... better

----

## Use JS Selectors

```
$(".js-cart .js-count").html(count);
$(".js-cart__count").html(count);
```

----

# Add linters to your code editors


## Hack the industry pulse

* Bleeding edge. Hottest. (0-18 months)
* Best practices (3+ years)
* What’s on the mind of the community?

Notes: Todo show how to do this...

----

## Always test your code before submitting

Avoid the dreaded `-g`

* Wipe your node modules
* Re-install node version
* Ask a friend to try out

----

## Manage node versions

* nvmrc
* n

---

## Give credit were it is due
### We all copy pasta

Notes: Include license files or mentions in code comments. Add mention in your
readme. This also shows that you keep up.

----

## Drive & Passion
### Show it

Note:

----

* Why are you looking to leave your current position? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* What do you like to do when you aren’t coding (and the answer can be coding)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Tell me about a project or moment you were most proud of in the last year<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

# Invest in learning

----

# How do you keep up with the industry?

Notes: If a scientist doesn't keep up with research in their field,
they will become obsolete. This was one of my pass/fail questions. Why? If you
are not invested in learning, you will not be an active team member.

# Learning

- (steal some ideas form artist way about making lists of things you feel iffy about.
challenge yourself to spend time on 1-2)
- Look at local ngo or business in your neighborhood (my first site was for a professor)
